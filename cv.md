### About
>‘Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
  The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get...'
                                    ― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland 
                                    
I like computer science and programming since my school years. 
Probably because my teacher was quite creative in presenting the material. 
His lessons have always been interesting. At school, I gained experience of working with computers and office programs.
All the time I did not leave the thought of programming. When I decided on the direction,  
I began to study HTML / CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, version control, webpack. 
I have taken courses that provided me with systematic information and then started writing code by my own.
I am applying for the position of trainee/junior front-end developer.
